# JNetCall
Java VM .NET Call abstraction

## History
In the past there was atleast one solution for .NET Framework 4.5+ and Java 8 for reusing software libraries written in Java.
But now I needed the ability to call current Java 18 code from C# 10 on .NET 6, so I created this project here.

## Summary
* Call Java from C#
